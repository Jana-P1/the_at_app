# the AT app

*your reminder that you're **A**lready **T**here*

The AT app is a full-stack application with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) capability built using a Python-based Flask web framework and a PostgreSQL database.

## Motivation
Have you ever filled yourself up with so much self-doubt it depleted your self-confidence and you actually talked yourself out of doing something?

+ Did you decide not to submit your application to that job because you felt you lacked enough experience?

+ Did you change your mind about that race because you felt weren't in *the* best shape and would, therefore, embarrass yourself?

Well, I have...

## Purpose
The AT app helps people find their misplaced self confidence, by reminding them of their own success and greatness, to pursue the challenges that once intimidated them.

## Description/Pseudocode
The AT app allows users to create and post their success stories.

## My deployment configurations on heroku need some refactoring
## For now, please run locally 
```
python3 app.py

```
